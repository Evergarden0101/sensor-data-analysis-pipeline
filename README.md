# Sensor data analysis pipeline
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
### Frontend
- ``npm install -g @vue/cli``
- ``npm install vue-router@4``

### Backend
- Inside back-enfd folder: ``python -m venv .venv``
- macOS: ``source .venv/bin/activate``
- Windows: ``.venv\Scripts\activate``
- ``pip install Flask``
- Initialize database: ``flask --app src/app init-db``


### Requirements
- Flask
- Vue 3

## Usage
- Vue: ``npm run serve``
- Flask: ``flask --app src/app run``
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.
